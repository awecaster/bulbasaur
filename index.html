    <h4> Bulbasaur #001 </h4>

  <img id= "image" src = "images/bulb.png">


  <p id= "p1"> Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokemon that has
    blue-green skin with darker green patches. It has red eyes
    with white pupils and pointed, ear-like structures on top of
    its head. Its snout is short and blunt, and it has a wide mouth.
    A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw
    when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three
    sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown
    from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with
    energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich
    seeds contained within.

    <h4> Ivysaur #002 </h4>
  <img id= "image2" src = "images/ivysaur.png">
  <p id= "p2"> Ivysaur is a quadruped Pokemon similar to a dinosaur.
     It has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head
      are pointed ears with black inside, and it has narrow red eyes.
       It has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth. Two pointed
        teeth protrude from its upper jaw. Each of its feet have
        three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into
         a large pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy
          green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant
          prevents Ivysaur from standing on its hind legs and forces
           its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to
           bloom, it gives off a distinct, strong sweet-smelling
           aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start
           spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its
           upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the
           strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. Ivysaur's natural
            habitat is plains. However, it is rare, as many are in
            captivity.

    <h4> Venusaur #003 </h4>
  <img id="image3" src = "images/venusaur.png">
  <p id="p3"> Venusaur is a squat, quadruped Pokemon with bumpy, blue-green
    skin. It has small, circular red eyes, a short, blunt snout, and a wide
    mouth with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw.
    On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish pink insides.
    It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed
    in a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick,
    brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur will have a seed
    in the center of its flower. As Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back grows larger and two smaller pink
flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. The weight of the
flower causes its legs to become sturdier in order to support it.
Additional leaves with woody stems, which are supported by vines, are
grown around the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on
its forehead below the new flower.
Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into
energy, which causes the flower to take on colors that are more vibrant.
The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokemon. This scent
becomes stronger after a rainy day. In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated
the ability to manipulate nature and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur
 and Ivysaur. This Pokemon is rarely found in the wild, but has been known
 to inhabit grasslands.
